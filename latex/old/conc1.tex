%% \section{Summary and discussions}
In this paper, we considered the problem of enumerating maximal repeats in a text, one of the most fundamental problems in string algorithms, we presented the first output-sensitive algorithms for enumerating all maximal repeats in a text in time proportinal to the size of the corresponding CDAWG. 

Since the proposed algorithm relies only on access to a set of array data structures as a blackbox, we expect that it will benifit from the future development of these data structures without any additional cost. Moreover, it is a simple and efficient array-based algorithm. Hence, we hope that our algorithm will be able to replace the role of the CDAWGs large-scale sequence analysis applications.
