In this paper, we study the problem of enumerating all distinct maximal repeats in a given string using the suffix array (SA). Although all the previous algorithms required linear time for the task regardless of the number $\mu$ of maximal repeats, we present a simple and faster algorithm that can enumerate all maximal repeats in $O(e_R)$ time and $O(\sigma^2 \log n)$ working space, where $e_R$ denotes the number of right extensions of maximal repeats satisfying $\mu\le e_R\le n$, which can be significantly smaller than the string length for highly repetitive strings. Our algorithm uses the SA with as auxiliary data structures the inverse SA, and the range-minima query structure on the longest common prefix (LCP) array, which can be computed from the SA in linear time and occupy $O(n)$ space. 
Moreover, we show that all maximal repeats can be enumerated in $O(e_R \;\textrm{polylog}(n))$ time and space simultaneously using existing compressed text indexes. 
The key to the time complexity sensitive to $e_R$ is a simple and modular algorithm that combines a simulated top-down traversal of suffix tree with constant-time left-branchingity testing in a novel way, which enables faster enumeration for repetitive texts.
