\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
In this paper, we presented a simple and faster algorithm
for enumerating all distinct maximal repeats in a string
in $O(e_R)$ time using the suffix array and other indexing structures based on a novel search strategy. By a modified algorithm, we showed that the set of all minimal rare words of $k$ or more occurrences can be enumerated in $O(e_R + e_L + |\MRW_{\ge k}(S)|)$ time for every $k\ge 1$.

Using compressed indexes, we also presented $O(e_R \polylog(n))$ time and space algorithms, which is the first sublinear, repetitiveness-aware algorithms for highly repetitive strings.

%% This paper studied enumeration of distinct maximal repeats in strings using suffix arrays, focusing on repetitiveness measure $e_R$. We proposed an $O(e_R)$ time algorithm using the suffix array and range-minimum queries, and This marks the first sublinear, repetitiveness-aware algorithms for highly repetitive strings.
