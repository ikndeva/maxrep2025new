\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
In this paper, we present a simple and faster algorithm
for enumerating all distinct maximal repeats in a string
in $e_R$, using the suffix array and auxiliary structures as black box. Using compressed indexes, we also have $O(e_R \polylog(n))$ time and space algorithms, which is the first sublinear, repetitiveness-aware algorithms for highly repetitive strings.

%% This paper studied enumeration of distinct maximal repeats in strings using suffix arrays, focusing on repetitiveness measure $e_R$. We proposed an $O(e_R)$ time algorithm using the suffix array and range-minimum queries, and This marks the first sublinear, repetitiveness-aware algorithms for highly repetitive strings.
